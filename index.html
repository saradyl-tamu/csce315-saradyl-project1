                <h3>About Me:</h3>
                <p>Howdy! My name is Sara Dyl and I'm a currenly a junior at 
                    <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html">Texas A&M University</a> in College Station, Texas. 
                    I'm working towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. 
                    At Texas A&M I'm involved in the Society of Women Engineers, Aggie Women in Comp Sci, Intramural Indoor Volleyball, 
                    and Intramural Beach Volleyball. Additionally, I currently work as a <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/academics/peer-teachers/current-peer-teachers.html">Peer Teacher</a> 
                    for the Texas A&M University Computer Science and Engineering Department. My freshman year I lived at Harrington Hall by the Quad and Commons, and now I live at Gardens 
                    Apartments by Century Square. 
                </p>
                <p>I had no previous coding experience outside of ENGR 102 when I started Computer Science after ETAM, 
                    and initially struggled with my classes. Since then I've learned a lot from friends, professors, and YouTube, and I've found a love 
                    for the unique thought processes, problem solving, and environment in computer science. I'm particularly interested in web development, 
                    software engineering, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. 
                </p>
                <p>  
                    Outside of computer science, I love to spend time with my family and friends and pursue my hobbies. 
                    I've been weightlifting for about 2 years, and going to the gym has become a huge part of my life. I used to play competitive travel volleyball, 
                    but now I coach teams, give private lessons, and play intramural volleyball for fun. I recently started yoga with my mother and it's made a 
                    positive impact on my life. I also love Formula 1, which I watch with my father and brother. We went to the Circuit of the Americas Practice 
                    Session in Austin, Texas last year and it was amazing. Lastly, I love animals and I have two of my own. I have a tabby cat named Jippi and a 
                    German Shepherd named Kaia, and they're both so sweet and adorable.
