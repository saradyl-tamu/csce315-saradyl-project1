                        <p>REViews is a project I completed with a team of 4 at TAMU HowdyHack.
                            We had never met, and in under 24 hours, we were able to conceive and create REViews,
                            a website meant to act as a forum for TAMU students to discuss and learn about professors,
                            classes, and organizations at Texas A&M. Using Figma, AWS, and Next.JS, we were able to fully
                            implement one branch of the website.
