                <p><strong>Tutoring:</strong> Throughout high school I volunteered as a tutor, helping other students complete homework and class assignments, as well as understand
                difficult concepts.</p>

                <p><strong>Vounteer Coaching:</strong> I volunteered multiple times coaching youth volleyball teams involved in different programs at NRG Volleyball.
                    Among these were teams of 12-14 year old girls as well as a high school men's team. This entailed offering personalized feedback, organizing practices,
                    mentoring, and working with other coaches, parents, and players.</p>

                <p><strong>STEMFest:</strong> The Society of Women in Engineering (SWE) at TAMU organized STEMFest.
                    I worked closely with 7 others as a member of the Logistics Commitee. We coordinated an event promoting STEM for 100+ Girl Scouts. This 
                    involved months of planning and work, including outreach to campus organizations, balancing budgets, managing event 
                    entertainment, and arranging event venues. </p>
