                    <p>Throughout high school I volunteered as a tutor, helping other students complete homework and class assignments, as well as understand

                    <p>I volunteered multiple times coaching youth volleyball teams involved in different programs at <a href="https://www.nrgvbc.com/">NRG Volleyball</a>.
                        Among these were teams of 12-14 year old girls as well as a high school men's team. This entailed offering personalized feedback, organizing practices,
                        mentoring, and working with other coaches, parents, and players.</p>

                    <p>The <a href="https://swe.org/">Society of Women in Engineering (SWE)</a> at TAMU organized STEMFest.
                        I worked closely with 7 others as a member of the Logistics Commitee. We coordinated an event promoting STEM for 100+ Girl Scouts. This 
                        involved months of planning and work, including outreach to campus organizations, balancing budgets, managing event 
                        entertainment, and arranging event venues. </p>
